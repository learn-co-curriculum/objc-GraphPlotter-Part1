0) Deal with TODOs
0.1) Deal with "Default" implementation of optional delegate methods in their own methods
0.2) Remove prepositions from method names?
0.5) Deal with zero point duplication...
1) Make interval method optional
2) Write README for use
3) Make Cocoapod
4) Breakdown solution into pieces for labs (M-est of VPs)
4.1) Extras: Shadows, alpha, transforms (3-D), more UIBezierPath, (contexts other than drawRect)
5) Error handling
6) Basic CoreAnimation of lines
7) Zoom / Scroll
8) Deal with anti-aliasing (or half points on screen issue)

In total, 3 days of labs/lecture potentially.

Lectures
1) Core Graphics - drawRectContext (not building your own),
2) Math?
3) Custom Delegates / Datasources
4) Cocoapod
5) Core Animation
