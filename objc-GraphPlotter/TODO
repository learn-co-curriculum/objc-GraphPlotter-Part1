0) Deal with TODOs
 ------- 0.1) Deal with "Default" implementation of optional delegate methods in their own methods
 ------- 0.2) Remove prepositions from method names?
 ------- 0.5) Deal with zero point duplication...
 ------- 0.6) Add reloadGraph;
 ------- 0.7) Remove extra calls to delegate and datasource methods, so its reflective of the way things are generally done.

2) Write README for use
 ------- 3) Make Cocoapod
4) Breakdown solution into pieces for labs (M-est of VPs)
4.1) Extras: Shadows, alpha, transforms (3-D), more UIBezierPath, (contexts other than drawRect)
5) Error handling
6) Basic CoreAnimation of lines
7) Zoom / Scroll
8) Deal with anti-aliasing (or half points on screen issue)
9) Make interval method optional

In total, 3 days of labs/lecture potentially.

Lectures
1) Core Graphics - drawRectContext (not building your own),
2) Math?
3) Custom Delegates / Datasources
5) Core Animation
